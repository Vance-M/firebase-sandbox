# IGNW Code Challenge
### This app was designed to grab Github users by username and store them into a firebase storage.
Thank you for taking the time to look through my app and please let me know what I could have done better.

To reach the deployed app please click this link:

To search for a user, type desired username into the search bar and press enter. If successful a message will display 
saying the user was added to the DB and the table underneath will update with the users information. If unsuccessful a
message will display showing why, the user wasn't found or was already in the database.
